    MINIFIED SAINT INSIGNIA
    *** note, adapted for server-side explore ***

      This accounts for the possibility of attributed values that are attached to the saint
      (i.e. returned from search results).  It also handles the possiblity that there are no additional
      values (i.e. if we just select a random group of saints)

    Creates the small logo/insignia for a given saint
    Expects the following local variable to be passed to the partial:
      - saint: saint model object from database
%>

<%
    # Get attached properties, if exists
    attached_name = saint.get_attached_property(:name)
    attached_attribs = saint.get_attached_property(:attributes)

    # Get data we need, either through the attached values or from the database
    saint_color = attached_attribs.present? ? SaintInsigniaFilter.get_color_by_attribs(attached_attribs) : SaintInsigniaFilter.get_color(saint)
    saint_insignia = attached_attribs.present? ? SaintInsigniaFilter.get_insignia_by_attribs(attached_attribs) : SaintInsigniaFilter.get_insignia(saint)
    saint_name  = attached_name.present? ? attached_name : saint.get_metadata_value(MetadataKey::NAME)
