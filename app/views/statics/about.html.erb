    <h2>About Saintstir &copy;</h2><br/>

    <p>Saintstir is a search engine that makes searching for, learning about and venerating the
    saints of the Catholic Church fun! Through an easy-to-use explorer, Saintstir will
    help you to discover facts about your favorite saints, discover saints that you've never
    known (but wish you had), and share your personal stories and prayers with friends.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, you'll learn why each saint is relevant for our modern world, and how our
    saints can teach, guide, and assist us through our journey on Earth.</p>

    <p>The Catholic saints who have a devoted following do so primarily because they practiced and perfected
    graces that people wish to emulate: for example, patience, or perseverance, or courage, etc.  We
    believe that its a saint's virtues and personal stories that capture the essence of who they
    are - and that lies at the center of the saints featured on Saintstir.</p>

    <p>But its more than a mere search engine.  It provides a taxonomy on the saints by factoring in
    life experiences, graces, along with biographical details such as historical time periods, to
    make the saints more accessible to everyone.</p>

    <p>Saintstir is a great site not only discover saints, but also to venerate
    saints with others.  Log into Saintstir with your Facebook &copy;, Twitter &copy; or Google &copy; account.
    Add a prayer to the saints and share a story about that saint if (s)he has had a particular impact on your life.
    Enrich others through your experiences.</p>

    <p>Its also very easy to integrate Saintstir into your own apps and websites.
    If you are a web designer or a blogger, you can easily add our saint tiles to your site - just copy and paste the
    code links next to each saint.  If you are an app developer, our search and filtering APIs are easy to use and
    avaiable to the public.  See the <a href="/statics/developers">Developer's Guide</a>.

    <p>We sincerely hope that Saintstir will help you to discover that the saints, our extended family in heaven, are
    indeed alive and yearing to help us reach the beatific vision that God will us all to share in.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Sincerely, </p>
    <p>Jonathan, Julia, and the Saintstir &copy; Team</p>
